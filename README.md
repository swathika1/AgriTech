# AgriTech

Monitoring and management of rate of water, soil health, and crop health using IoT and sensors.
 
# Expected outcomes and gains

Proper care and constant monitoring of plants are vital in the field of agriculture
which ensures the production of high quality yield of crops.
Constant accurate monitoring cannot be done manually which is why we can use smart
monitoring which produces better results.
-> monitoring in constant time intervals
-> ensuring unnecessary wastage of water 
-> ensuring right nutrient content in soil for effective growth
-> Access to various ideas and tips in crop production

# Gap Analysis

High Cost: Devices which are needed for IoT in farming are expensive. Sensors may be expensive, and it may take more cost to implement the equipment in the fields.
Less Security: The data collected by the sensors has less chance of being transmitted to other electronic devices, but it is difficult to secure large quantities of values.
Lack of Technology/Infrastructure: Farmers may not be able to make full use of this technology if they are habited in rural areas, which is far from internet facilities.

# Target Audience

At unfavorable climate conditions, farmers can’t foresee or schedule their farming works. A despair need for an algorithm that could attain the precise and reliable data about the necessities for the crop cultivation is required. So the primary user of this method are farmers, and quality crops at fixed time will be the primary benefits of using it.

# Solution

Monitoring the rate of water, soil health, crop health, temperature and humidity using IoT, AI and sensors. In this era, many gardeners are still using a manual system to water and monitor their plants. This project offers a solution where it integrates between the Internet of Things (IoT) system and Android apps to monitor the plant's growth with a real-time data monitoring and also provides the system control and also give more tips like “about the cultivation of plant and fertilizations, soil suitability etc…”. The root cause of the problem is to waste plenty of water(plenty of water causes soil erosion) , and soil range is decreased continuously and the profit is decreased a lot to the farmers. To overcome this, we create an app to monitoring the water level properly, maintain soil levels and maintain plant nutrition’s. If any lacking is happened while farming the sensor give a message through the app to the gardener /Farmer. Also, gardeners can control the air ventilation system to bring in oxygen into the greenhouse and remove carbon dioxide.
